# wikipedia_automation
Hey! This is just a simple automation of wikipedia I created using selenium and python.
It basically asks you what you want to know, and when you give it an input, it searches it up on wikipedia and shows you the result
But if you want to make it even cooler, you can make it a terminal command!
![wikipedia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69780531/96091290-08a1fc80-0ee7-11eb-9e53-56eaf5eaf3c5.png)

The steps to do that are as follows
1.)take the wikipedia file in this repository and place it in your /usr/bin/ folder
